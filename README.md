# Customizable Support Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

This project is a smart e-commerce support chatbot built with **Next.js**, **Google Gemini API**, and **ShadCN UI components**. The chatbot provides real-time assistance to users, analyzes their sentiments, and stores all conversation data in the browser's `localStorage`. It also collects user feedback and saves it for future insights. For now I have taken a usecase as if it is a support assistant for an e-commerce store of shoes named [Snikre](https://www.snikre.com)(which is my brand itself).

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Powered by the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent responses.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of user messages (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **Local Data Storage**: Stores conversation history and sentiment data in `localStorage` for persistence.
- **Feedback Collection**: Collects user feedback on products for sentiment tracking and insights.
- **Modern UI**: Built with ShadCN's elegant and responsive UI components.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for performance and usability.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:

   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
   ```

4. **Set Up Google Authentication**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application" as the application type
   - Add a name for your OAuth client
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`
   - Click "Create" and note your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Add these credentials to your `.env.local` file

5. **Generate NextAuth Secret**
   Generate a secure random string for NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   Add this to your `.env.local` file.

6. **Run the Application**
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

7. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users type messages in the chatbot interface.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Each user message is analyzed for sentiment using a lightweight sentiment analysis function.
3. **Response Generation**: The Google Gemini API generates intelligent responses based on the conversation context.
4. **Data Persistence**: 
   - The entire conversation, including sentiment data, is saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
   - Feedback for specific products is collected and also stored in `localStorage`.
